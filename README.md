### **Key Features & Functionalities:**  

1. **Phone Number Validation & Formatting:**  
   - Checks if a given phone number is valid.  
   - Formats phone numbers into international and national standards.  

2. **Extracting Phone Number Details:**  
   - Identifies the country and carrier of the phone number.  
   - Retrieves the time zone associated with the number.  

3. **Batch Processing:**  
   - Accepts multiple phone numbers and processes them in bulk.  
   - Saves results in structured formats like CSV or JSON.  

4. **Error Handling & Optimization:**  
   - Handles invalid phone numbers gracefully.  
   - Provides meaningful error messages if the input is incorrect.

### **Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- **Python** (for scripting and automation)  
- **phonenumbers** (for validation, carrier details, and location)  
- **pandas** (for structured data processing)  
- **re (Regular Expressions)** (for phone number extraction from text)
